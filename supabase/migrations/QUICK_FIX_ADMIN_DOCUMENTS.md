# Quick Fix for Admin Document Access Issue

## Problem
Admin panel shows "Failed to load documents" error when trying to view uploaded documents.

## Immediate Solution

### Option 1: Simple Migration (Recommended)
Apply this simple migration to disable RLS temporarily:

**File**: `supabase/migrations/008_simple_admin_document_access.sql`

Run in your Supabase SQL editor or via CLI:
```sql
-- Disable RLS on uploaded_documents table to allow admin access
ALTER TABLE public.uploaded_documents DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Grant necessary permissions to authenticated users (including admins)
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON public.uploaded_documents TO authenticated;
GRANT USAGE ON SEQUENCE public.uploaded_documents_upload_id_seq TO authenticated;
```

### Option 2: Fallback Code (Already Implemented)
The DocumentViewer component now has fallback logic that:
1. Tries to use admin RPC functions first
2. Falls back to direct table access if RPC functions don't exist
3. Provides detailed console logging for debugging

## Testing Steps

### 1. Test Document Upload (User Side)
1. Open browser developer tools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Submit a service application with documents
4. Look for these console messages:
   - âœ… "Preparing to insert documents for application: [ID]"
   - âœ… "Documents inserted successfully: [count]"

### 2. Test Admin Document Access
1. Login as admin
2. Open browser developer tools (F12)
3. Go to Console tab
4. View an application with documents
5. Look for these console messages:
   - âœ… "Fetching documents for application ID: [ID]"
   - âœ… "RPC function not available, trying direct table access..."
   - âœ… "Direct table access succeeded"
   - âœ… "Found documents: [count]"

### 3. Expected Results After Fix
- Admin can see all uploaded documents
- Document preview works (images show, PDFs can be downloaded)
- Document verification (approve/reject) works
- Application approval is blocked until documents are verified

## Troubleshooting

### If Still Getting "Failed to load documents":

1. **Check Console Logs**
   - Open browser developer tools
   - Look for specific error messages
   - Share the exact error message for further help

2. **Check Database Directly**
   - Go to Supabase dashboard
   - Run this query to check if documents exist:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM uploaded_documents;
   ```

3. **Check RLS Status**
   - Run this query to check RLS status:
   ```sql
   SELECT schemaname, tablename, rowsecurity 
   FROM pg_tables 
   WHERE tablename = 'uploaded_documents';
   ```
   - `rowsecurity` should be `false` after applying the migration

4. **Manual RLS Disable** (if migration doesn't work)
   - Go to Supabase dashboard â†’ SQL Editor
   - Run: `ALTER TABLE public.uploaded_documents DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;`

### If Documents Aren't Being Inserted:

1. **Check User Application Submission**
   - Look for console errors during application submission
   - Check if documents are being uploaded in the UI

2. **Check Database Permissions**
   - Ensure the `uploaded_documents` table exists
   - Check if user has INSERT permissions

## Current Implementation Status

âœ… **Completed**:
- Fallback logic in DocumentViewer
- Enhanced error handling and logging
- Simple migration for RLS disable
- Document verification workflow
- Admin UI enhancements

ðŸ”„ **Next Steps**:
1. Apply the simple migration (`008_simple_admin_document_access.sql`)
2. Test document upload and admin access
3. Check console logs for any remaining issues

## Security Note

The simple migration disables RLS temporarily. For production use, you should:
1. Re-enable RLS with proper admin policies
2. Use the more comprehensive migration (`007_fix_admin_document_access.sql`)
3. Implement proper admin authentication checks

## Files Modified

- `src/components/admin/documents/DocumentViewer.tsx` - Added fallback logic
- `src/components/services/ServiceApplicationDialog.tsx` - Added debugging
- `supabase/migrations/008_simple_admin_document_access.sql` - Simple RLS fix

The system now has multiple fallback mechanisms to ensure admin document access works regardless of migration status.
